# Game of Thrones Analysis

Here are some information I'm still working on getting out of the data 
#### . The number of battles each king fought on the attacking side and the number of battles they defended comparatively
#### . Number of times they won when attacked
#### . Number of times they won when they defended
#### . Types of battles each king fought most often
#### . Number of times each king won when attacked
#### . Compared to the number they won when defending or instead of kings you could do it in terms of houses
#### . Attacker size of each king/house over the years
#### . Defender size of each king/house over the years
#### . Battle type and outcome i.e how many times each particlular battle type resulted in wins or losses
#### . Correlation of all the other variables with outcome of the battles
